## Science outreach and communication
Here are a few science communication and crowd-funded projects I am involved with:  <br />
[BrainChem (& Ecology)](https://www.facebook.com/brainchem/), a popular science site I run with a Chemical Neurobiologist, [Pratik Kumar](http://pratikkumar15.wixsite.com/pratik).  <br />
[Science Outside](https://scienceoutside.com/), a website featuring fun stories from field scientists - submit your stories to us!  <br />
[Crowd-funded project](https://experiment.com/projects/a-mother-s-work-is-never-done-using-thermal-imaging-to-detect-torpor-in-nesting-hummingbirds/dashboard/metrics) on nesting hummingbirds that I am working on with [Erich Eberts](https://ebertser.wordpress.com/author/ebertser/) - a past mentee/current collaborator of mine- and other collaborators.  <br />
Crowd-funded [project](https://experiment.com/projects/do-hummingbirds-actually-sleep) titled "Do hummingbirds actually sleep" I worked on with Dr. Don Powers and students.  <br />

Check out [Open Explorer](https://openexplorer.nationalgeographic.com/home), an open National Geographic platform for scientists to post field notes and engage with the public.  <br />


Below are snapshots of my writing and videos for the public!  <br />   <br />

### Blog article for National Geographic / Science Outside

I wrote a blog article about hummingbird torpor and why I love collecting their pee, which used to be hosted on National Geographic's (now defunct) blog. You can find it on [Science Outside](https://scienceoutside.com/portfolio/my-two-recent-obsessions-have-been-hummingbird-pee-and-torpor/).  <br />
