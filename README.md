## Welcome to my test homepage

I am a Rose Postdoctoral Fellow at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and am testing out the github website through RMarkdown.

### Research

I study hummingbird whole-animal physiological ecology. I use respirometry and isotope methods to measure how much energy hummingbirds spend on different activities, to construct daily energy budgets for different species. I am now working on integrating transcriptomics into my work.
